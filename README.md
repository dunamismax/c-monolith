## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with linking errors:**

- Run `make clean` then `make` to rebuild from scratch
- Ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed: `xcode-select --install`

**Test suite fails:**

- Ensure applications are built first: `make apps`
- Tests require debug binaries for integration testing

**clang-tidy warnings:**

- Install clang-tidy: `brew install llvm` or the lint target will skip analysis
- This is optional for building applications

**Applications not starting:**

- Build first: `make apps`
- Then run: `make run-calculator` (or other app names)
