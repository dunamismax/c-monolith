# Network Applications

Network programming projects including client-server applications, protocols, and distributed systems.

## Featured Applications

### Real-Time Chat System

A complete client-server chat application demonstrating perfect socket programming and real-time communication:

#### **chat_server** - Multi-Client Chat Server

- **Purpose**: Real-time chat server supporting up to 32 concurrent clients
- **Features**: Thread-safe client management, message broadcasting, graceful shutdown
- **Architecture**: TCP socket server with pthread-based client handling
- **Usage**: `./build/release/bin/chat_server [port]` (default: 8080)

#### **chat_client** - Interactive Chat Client

- **Purpose**: Real-time chat client with interactive messaging
- **Features**: Username validation, real-time message display, command system
- **Architecture**: TCP client with dedicated receive thread
- **Usage**: `./build/release/bin/chat_client [server_ip] [port]`

#### Key Technical Features

- **Perfect Socket Programming**: Proper TCP socket setup, error handling, and cleanup
- **Thread-Safe Broadcasting**: Mutex-protected client list with real-time message distribution
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling with self-pipe trick for clean server termination
- **Protocol Design**: Custom message protocol with timestamps and message types
- **Concurrent Connections**: Each client handled in separate pthread with shared state management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive username and message validation with bounds checking
