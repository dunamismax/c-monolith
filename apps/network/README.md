# Network Applications

Network programming projects including client-server applications, protocols, and distributed systems.

## Application Types

This directory contains network programming applications such as:

- **Chat Applications**: Real-time messaging clients and servers
- **HTTP Servers**: Basic web servers and API endpoints
- **File Transfer**: Secure file sharing and transfer protocols
- **Network Utilities**: Network diagnostic and monitoring tools
- **Protocol Implementations**: Custom protocols and communication systems
- **Distributed Systems**: Multi-node applications and coordination systems
- **Proxy Servers**: HTTP/HTTPS proxy implementations
- **Network Scanners**: Port scanners and network discovery tools

## Characteristics

- Socket programming with TCP/UDP protocols
- Client-server architecture patterns
- Concurrent connection handling
- Network security and encryption
- Protocol parsing and implementation
- Error handling for network failures
- Cross-platform network compatibility

## Development Focus

- Robust socket programming with proper error handling
- Thread-safe concurrent connection management
- Network protocol implementation and parsing
- Security considerations (authentication, encryption)
- Performance optimization for high-throughput applications
- Graceful handling of network failures and timeouts
- Clean separation of network and application logic
