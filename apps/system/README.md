# System Programming Applications

Low-level system interaction projects including shells, system utilities, and OS interaction tools.

## Application Types

This directory contains system programming applications such as:

- **Custom Shells**: Command-line interpreters and shell implementations
- **File Encryption**: Secure file encryption and decryption tools
- **System Monitors**: Process monitoring and system resource tracking
- **Memory Managers**: Custom memory allocation and management systems
- **Process Controllers**: Process spawning, management, and IPC tools
- **File System Tools**: Custom file system operations and utilities
- **Device Drivers**: User-space device interaction programs
- **System Daemons**: Background services and system processes

## Characteristics

- Direct operating system API usage
- Process management and inter-process communication
- File system manipulation and monitoring
- Memory management and optimization
- Signal handling and system events
- Platform-specific system calls
- Low-level hardware interaction

## Development Focus

- Understanding of operating system internals
- Safe system call usage with proper error handling
- Process lifecycle management (fork, exec, wait)
- Signal handling and process communication
- File descriptor management and I/O multiplexing
- Memory safety in low-level operations
- Platform abstraction for cross-OS compatibility
- Security considerations for privileged operations
