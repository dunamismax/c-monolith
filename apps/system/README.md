# System Programming Applications

Low-level system interaction projects including shells, system utilities, and OS interaction tools.

## Featured Applications

### Unix Shell Implementation

A complete custom shell demonstrating advanced system programming and process management:

#### **unix_shell** - Custom Unix Shell

- **Purpose**: Full-featured command-line interpreter with modern shell capabilities
- **Features**: Job control, I/O redirection, piping, command history, tab completion
- **Architecture**: Fork/exec process management with signal handling and background jobs
- **Usage**: `./build/release/bin/unix_shell` or `make run-unix_shell`

#### Key Technical Features

- **Process Management**: Complete fork/exec implementation with proper child process handling
- **I/O Redirection**: Full support for input (<), output (>), and append (>>) redirection
- **Pipeline Support**: Multi-command pipelines with proper file descriptor management
- **Job Control**: Background job tracking, signal handling, and process monitoring
- **Built-in Commands**: cd, pwd, exit, help, jobs, history, env, export, unset
- **Advanced Features**: Tilde expansion (~), wildcard globbing (\*, ?), command history
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Linux and macOS with optional readline support

## Application Types
